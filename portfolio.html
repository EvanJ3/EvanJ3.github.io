                    Since I've always been someone who enjoys tinkering and learning new things, in my spare capacity 
                    I often take on projects to test out and pick up some new skills. As you'll no doubt notice from 
                    the eclectic nature of my projects below, the scope and subjects of them can vary widely. Hopefully
                    you will enjoy looking at or maybe even implementing some of them for yourself.

                    <p class="lead-text">One of the best ways to better understand a paper, concept, or experiment is to do it from scratch.
                        It is with this approach in mind that I have shared some of my replications of select experiments that I've curated
                        thoughout my graduate program. Successfully replicating a paper or experiment can be time-consuming and often
                        we lack all the information needed for replication in the origional paper. Such ambiguities can be frustrating, but also
                        allow a bit of indivdual exploration and expression. This process has also helped me write more concise and self-contained papers
                        as I try to avoid the many potholes laid by other authors.

                <p class="lead-text">Reading, digesting, and most importantly understanding the underlying intuition behind academic papers 
                    can be an excruciatingly painful and time consuming process even for Phds. Although there are many ongoing changes to the landscape, 
                    the academic journal format for papers is immensly restrictive and is an inefficent way to truly convey novel ideas to the research 
                    community. During graduate school, I dealt with these dense papers through margin annotations and sticky notes. I personally found that
                    this was the best way for me to parse the authors work, and to permit an easy refresh of the paper upon a later read through. After listening
                    to one of Lex Friedman's podcasts with João Batalha and Luís Batalha, the founders of Fermat's Library, a platform for the collaborative
                    expert annotation of academic papers, I became inspired to share annotations of my own here. If even one person finds them useful in better 
                    understanding these papers I consider it a successful venture.
