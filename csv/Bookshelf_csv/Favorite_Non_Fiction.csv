0,The Incerto Collection,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Non_Fiction_Images/Incerto.JPG,Nassim,Taleb,5,"In this five book series known as Incerto, Nassim Taleb lays out the case for extremely interesting and unconventional philosphy best summarized by one of skepticism informed by probablity. From markets to man, Nassim applys his own robust mathematical frameworks to explain the world around us and expose quite a few who only claim to know the answers along the way. Deeply funny and thought provoking each book in the series is a personal favorite of mine."
1,Permanent Record,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Non_Fiction_Images/Permanent_Record.JPG,Edward,Snowden,5,"Probably one of the most mis-understood indivudals in recent times is Edward Snowden. After his revalations about government survailence of private citizens there were many actors who broadcast a false vision of the man based solely on their own interests. Reading this candid biograhy which also is itself an interesteing narrative it becomes apparently clear the type of integretiy, courage, and bravery requried of whistleblowers like Ed. "
2,Mathematics and its History,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Non_Fiction_Images/Mathematics_and_its_History.JPG,John,Stillwell,5,"Often times when studying mathematics teachers neglect to inform students that this great and vast body of mathematics and science we presently have wasn't brought about in an instant, but rather represents a continum of constant improvement and discovery by many people over centruies. Personally, I found that the historical explaination and context that this book offers on a variety of mathematical subjects solidified my intution and comfort with these subjects"
3,A Brief History of Time,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Non_Fiction_Images/A_Brief_History_of_Time.JPG,Stephen,Hawking,5,"Prior to reading, I always thought that this book was surely overhyped. No matter how great the author how could a book less than 200 pages give a intutive treatment of advanced physics and astronomical concepts such as space-time and blackholes. Clearly I was wrong. Although absent many of the technical details and intracaceis Hawking does a fantastic job at explaining the high level concepts of space-time that previously were only avalible to phd candidates."
4,Upheaval,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Non_Fiction_Images/Upheaval.JPG,Jared,Diamond,5,"I've always been a personal fan of Jared Diamond's uncanny ability to highlight and blend important historical pivot points into an inthralling and insightful narrative. In Upheaval, Diamond provides a theoretical framework on how nations advance after significant social, policatical, and ecnomic upheaval. His case driven approach analyzes the key factors and differentiators that utimately shape the nation future direction and ultimate success or failure."
5,War on Peace,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Non_Fiction_Images/War_on_Peace.JPG,Ronan,Farrow,5,"I've always been a tremendous fan of Ronan Farrow after reading his prize winning reporting on Harvery Winestien in 2018. Since then I came to discover his equally intersting and impressive past experience in the State Department catalogued wihtin this book. The value of diplomacy is often forgotten in the modern age, and this book does an excellent job at explaining the system, its history, and uncertain future given the growth of the industrial military complex."
