0,Artifical Intelligence a Modern Approach,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Textbook_Images/Artifical_Intelligence_a_Modern_Approach.JPG,Stuart,Russel,5,"This textbook although one of the densest in my bookshelf reads suprisingly easy and is probably what I would call the bible of AI. The authors give a full treatment of the field from over-promised disapointing beginings to our current modern explosion in AI intestest. Their ability to weave history and the natural emergence of topics also helps better understand the direction and history of the field. "
1,Deep Reinforcement Learning,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Textbook_Images/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning.JPG,Miguel,Morales,5,"While working on my Masters at Georgia Tech, I took a class on Reinforcement Learning and I can honeslty say I'm not sure if I would've made it out the other side if not for this book. Miguel, the author, actually served as the lead TA for this class as well, and I can honestly say that through his book he did a far better job at explaining concepts than our actaul professor. This book does an excelelnt job on practical implementations and intuition building. "
2,Convex Optimization,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Textbook_Images/Convex_Optimization.JPG,Stephen,Boyd,5,"For anyone who works in the field of optimization this book is surely known as sacred text. It is really remarkable the detail and rigour the authors put into explaing the detials and intraccies of so many different methods of optimization as well as their relevent applications. This book is without a doubt a guiding text for anyone who works in machine learning both for reference and for general knowlege. "
3,Introduction to Algorithims,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Textbook_Images/Algorithims.JPG,Thomas,Cormen,5,"In any computer programmers arsenal there should always be a book on algorithims and data strucutres. This text which really combines a full treatment of both, serves as my go to reference text. Each concept is demonstrated with a focus on building underlying intution, and the examples serve as excellent practical guides. Having tried several different texts in this subject I can say without a doubt this one takes the top spot."
4,High Performance Python,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Textbook_Images/High_Performance_Python.JPG,Micha,Gorelick,5,"Often in programming it is common practice to get a working concept of an algorithim first, and to worry about optimizing speed later as speedy code is almost always harder to read. This book acknowleges this workflow that developers do not write the speedy code from the start, instead it is a development process. The book also provides excellent information on how to get the most out of python based on your needs and complexity requirements. "
5,Linear Algebra Done Right,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Textbook_Images/Linear_Algebra_Done_Right.JPG,Sheldon,Axler,5,"The title of this book really says it all finally a text that does a full treatment of linear algebra right! Prior to reading this book I had always struggled to find a personal sense of intuition within linear algebra. After trying several textbooks which for the most part all have the same approach of utilizing determinants in proving the existance of eigenvalues. However, as Axler masterfully shows, this concept can be explained much more simply and intuitively without the use of determinants."
