0,A Gentleman in Moscow,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Fiction_Images/A_Gentleman_in_Moscow.JPG,Amor,Towles,5,"This book is probably my absolute personal favorite. Although not Russian himself, Amor Towles captures and recounts the soul of Russia and its literature tradition by telling the story of a (semi) exhiled aristocrat during the rise of the Soviet Union. If you haven't already read the Russian classic I highly reccomend reading them prior to this book to both enhance the experience and avoid any spoliers."
1,The Last Wish,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Fiction_Images/The_Last_Wish.JPG,Andrzej,Sapkowski,5,"Out of all the fantasy series that have created such deep and creative new worlds to explore, the Witcher series is undoubtedly my personal favorite. I was first exposed to the series after playing the game Witcher 3, and as soon as I realized there was an even more expansive history to this world Andrzej created I devoured the entire series. And yes although the Netflix series is good the source material is far better trust me. "
2,Anna Karenina,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Fiction_Images/Anna_Karenina.JPG,Leo,Tolstoy,5,"Anna Karenina was my second novel by Tolstoy, and although I had already had the ending spoiled prior it was still an amazing book that never failed to keep my attention despite knowning the ultimate destination. Similar to War and Peace, Tolstoy creates such vivid characters and scenes that driving a plot almost becomes an added bonus rather than the express purpose of his writing. No other author does such a superb job at capturing the human condition"
3,Animal Farm,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Fiction_Images/Animal_Farm.JPG,George,Orwell,5,"Although among Orwell's works 1984 typically overshawdows all others, I personally find that Animal Farm is the true essence of Orwell. It is always remarkable to me how in such a small and simple story of farm animals, Orwell was able to naturally weave together a narrative of history and critique of Stalinism in such a fascinating way."
4,War and Peace,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Fiction_Images/War_and_Peace.JPG,Leo,Tolstoy,5,"During the early days of the Pandemic, I decided to sit down and knock this tome off my reading bucket list. Although initally skeptical of its size, scope, and weight (my wrists actually got fairly sore at points) once I was just 100 pages in, the book's size was no longer an obstacle, but instead a boon of content to look forward to. This novel single handedly sparked by deep love for Russian literature and language. "
5,Fathers and Sons,./images/Bookshelf_Images/Favorite_Fiction_Images/Fathers_&_Sons.JPG,Ivan,Turgenev,5,"I began reading Father's and Son's rather recently and was hooked from the beginining. Turgenev with this novel has masterfully portrayed the internal and external struggles of relationships between generations. Despite being from a vastly different time, reading this book it often reminded and of the generational divide currently present in our current society. It is with this aspect of timelessness that I find this book so impactful. "
