Current Projects,SignaturePaws.org V2,./images/Project_Images/signature_paws_website.jpg,Javascript-HTML-SCSS-SQL,https://github.com/EvanJ3/Signature-Paws,"Previously I created this website using Wix due to a time crunch, but now that I have some extra time. I've taken to cloning the website with a few modification from scratch. Why pay someone to manage your site when you can do it yourself?"
Current Projects,Andrew Jones Custom Homes.com,./images/Project_Images/aj_homes_logo_filled.png,Javascript-HTML-SCSS-SQL,https://github.com/EvanJ3/Andrew-Jones-Homes,I'm working on creating a website for my dad's business to showcases some of the great homes he has built over the years while also serving as a tool to recurit talented sub-contractors to join his ongoing projects. Similar to my other sights everything is built from scratch.
Current Projects,DeepDubber,./images/Research_Images/Deep_Dub_Thumbnail.png,Pytorch-NLP-Computer Vision-Cuda,https://github.com/EvanJ3/Deep-Dubber,"Since the emergence of transformers in the field of natural language processing, which have vastly improved our capacity for langague translation, I have been working to extend this concept to the realm of audio dubbing. Using transformer networks for the translation task, and an additional GAN which transforms a source video into the target langague video I aim to achieve an AI assisted audio/visual dubbing platform."

Through several chart revisions and errouneous initizations even Sutton confesses he has no idea where his figures came from."
Reinforcement Learning Projects,Lunar Lander,./images/Project_Images/Lunar_Lander.png,Python-Pytorch-Tensorflow-DeepRL,https://gitfront.io/r/EvanJ03/280cecd1d109fef4252843ec1d0da7a476fcb2c8/Lunar-Lander-DQN/,"In this project, I apply some of Deepmind's innovations in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning to solve the open ai gym lunar lander enviornment. This implementation utiilzes Double Dueling DQN with priortized replay buffer."
