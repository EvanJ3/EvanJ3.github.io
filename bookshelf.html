                    At any given time I usually have about three books that I jump around between reading: one fiction, one non-ficiton/biographical, and one textbook or other dense book.
                    Personally, I've found that by keeping my selection like this and occasionally switching between them, I'm able to better digest and enjoy the material without losing interest. 
                    Below you will find the books that are my current reading stack. I'll try my best to keep this and the subsequent reviews current, but there will no doubt be some time lag.

                    Everyone has those certain books on the shelf that no matter how many times they are read incite the same 
                    and sometimes even greater feelings as in their first read through. Here are some of my personal all time 
                    favorite works of fiction. As you'll no doubt notice I'm a big fan Tolstoy. Reading his greatest tome
                    "War and Peace" during the pandemic ignited my apprecaition for Russian literature and langauge.

                    Although in my personal opinion Non-ficiton as a genre does not inspire quite the passion or enjoyment of fiction, there 
                    are still those select few books that once read demand to be shared. Below is a collection of my personal favorite works of non-fiction.
                    These books range from philosophy to investigative journalism, but one thing they all have in-common is their ability to enthrall 
                    even the most unsuspecting of readers.

                    Although not nearly as interesting of a reading experince from the previous two sections, reading textbooks
                    is an unavoidable part of learning any rigerous field or concept. However, selecting the right book or paper to 
                    learn a given concept can make the process exponentially easier or harder depending on your choice of book or author. 
                    Similar to exemplary teaching, there is much to be said about a well written and practical textbook. Below is a collection
                    of some of the most well written, practical, and pragmatic textbooks I've encountered in my academic and professional carrer.
                    Each does an excellent job at guiding you through complex topics and applying this knowlege to practical applicaitions. All 
                    textbooks are surely not created equally.
