                <p>"Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. 
                    The library should contain as much of what you don’t know as your financial means, 
                    mortgage rates and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. 
                    You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, 
                    and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menancingly. 
                    Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. 
                    Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.”</p>
